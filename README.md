# caretEnsemble
Framework for fitting multiple [caret models](https://github.com/topepo/caret) using the same re-sampling strategy as well as creating ensembles of such models.  Use `caretList` to fit multiple models, and then use `caretEnsemble` to combine them greedily, or `caretStack` to combine them using a caret model.

caretEnsemble was inspired by [medley](https://github.com/mewo2/medley), which in turn was inspired by Caruana et. al.'s (2004) paper [Ensemble Selection from Libraries of Models.](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~caruana/ctp/ct.papers/caruana.icml04.icdm06long.pdf)
