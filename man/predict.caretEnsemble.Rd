\title{Make predictions from a caretEnsemble. This function passes the data to each function in
turn to make a matrix of predictions, and then multiplies that matrix by the vector of
weights to get a single, combined vector of predictions.}
\usage{
\method{predict}{caretEnsemble}(object, keepNA, level = 0.95, se = FALSE,
  return_weights = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{\link{caretEnsemble}} to make predictions from.}

\item{keepNA}{deprecated, a logical indicating whether predictions should be made for all
cases where sufficient data exists or only for complete cases across all models. When
TRUE this does not predict for missing values. When FALSE, missing values are overwritten
with predictions where possible.}

\item{level}{tolerance/confidence level}

\item{se}{logical, should prediction errors be produced? Default is false.}

\item{return_weights}{a logical indicating whether prediction weights for each model for
each observation should be returned}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass to predict.train. Pass the \code{newdata}
argument here, DO NOT PASS the "type" argument.  Classification models will
return probabilities if possible, and regression models will return "raw".}
}
\value{
If \code{se=TRUE} a data.frame is returned with three columns, fit,
upr, and lwr which represent the predicted value, and the upper and lower
confidence intervals, defined by the \code{level} argument. If \code{se=false}
a numeric vector is returned of the predicted values. If \code{return_weights = TRUE}
an attribute is attached to the object returned by predict with a matrix of
the model weights for each observation.
}
\description{
Make predictions from a caretEnsemble. This function passes the data to each function in
turn to make a matrix of predictions, and then multiplies that matrix by the vector of
weights to get a single, combined vector of predictions.
}
\details{
The standard error here is not a measure of the uncertainty of the
predictions within each of the models in the ensemble, but instead a measure
of disagreement among the models for each observation.
}
\note{
Currently there is no support for NA handling in this function. A future
update to the \code{caret} package will allow for the proper handling of NA values.
An error will occur if the user passes newdata that contains missing values.
