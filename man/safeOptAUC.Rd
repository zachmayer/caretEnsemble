\title{Safe optimization of the AUC}
\usage{
safeOptAUC(X, Y, iter = 100L)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the matrix of predictors}

\item{Y}{the dependent variable}

\item{iter}{an integer for the number of iterations}
}
\value{
A numeric of the weights for each model
}
\description{
This algorithm optimizes the AUC for regression models to avoid ensembling
where the ensembled model fits worse than any component model
}
\details{
This optimizer uses a stopping criterion that if the optimized model
has an AUC that is worse than any individual model, it continues optimizing
until this is no longer the case.
