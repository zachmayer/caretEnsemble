\title{Convenience function for more in-depth diagnostic plots of caretEnsemble objects}
\usage{
\method{autoplot}{caretEnsemble}(object, xvars = NULL, show_class_id = 2L, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{caretEnsemble} object}

\item{xvars}{a vector of the names of x variables to plot against residuals}

\item{show_class_id}{For classification only: which class level to show on the plot}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass to autoplot}
}
\value{
A grid of diagnostic plots. Top left is the range of the performance
metric across each component model along with its standard deviation. Top right
is the residuals from the ensembled model plotted against fitted values.
Middle left is a bar graph of the weights of the component models. Middle
right is the disagreement in the residuals of the component models (unweighted)
across the fitted values. Bottom left and bottom right are the plots of the
residuals against two random or user specified variables.
}
\description{
This function provides a more robust series of diagnostic plots
for a caretEnsemble object.
