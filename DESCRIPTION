Description: This package consists primarily of one function: caretEnsemble.
    This function takes a collection of caret models and finds a good linear
    combination of those models, using either linear regression or iterative
    greedy selection. It returns an object of the caretEnsemlbe S3 class, which
    contains the models and has a predict class.  Currently, this framework
    supports regression models and 2-class classification models.  It DOES NOT
    allow you to combine multi-class classification models, or form combined
    ensembles of classification and regression models.\
