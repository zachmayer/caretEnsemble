Description: 3 primary functions: caretList, caretEnsemble,
    and caretStack.  caretList is a convenience function for fitting multiple
    caret::train models to the same dataset.  caretEnsemble will make a linear
    combination of these models using greedy forward selection, and caretList
    will make linear or non-linear combinations of these models using a caret
    model as a meta-model.
