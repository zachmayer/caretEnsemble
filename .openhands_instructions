# R Code Style Guide and Development Instructions

Your dev environment is *fully setup*. You do not need to install any packages.  They are all installed for you.

## Code Style

- Use base R and core packages rather than tidyverse
- Prefer data.table over data.frame for data manipulation
- Use :: operator for package functions (e.g., data.table::data.table).
  - Do not use `library` or `require`.  Import packages with ::
- Avoid for loops - use vectorized operations
- Use vapply instead of sapply
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write self-documenting code, minimize comments
- Follow strict R code style guidelines
- Write clean, lint-free, readable code
- Do not use error handling
- Do not use tryCatch / on.exit / try / withCallingHandlers / etc.
- Do not write excessive if/then/else statements

## Development Workflow

Use the Makefile targets for development:

### Basic Development

- `make dev` - Run basic development cycle (clean, style, document, lint, spell check, test)
- `make test` - Run unit tests
- `make lint` - Check code style and quality
- `make fix-style` - Auto-format code
- `make spell` - Check spelling

### Documentation

- `make document` - Generate documentation
- `make readme` - Build README
- `make vignettes` - Build vignettes

### Testing and Coverage

- `make coverage` - Generate and check coverage reports
- `make view-coverage` - View coverage report in browser
- `make check` - Run R CMD check locally

## Package Structure

- Put R code in R/
- Put tests in tests/testthat/
- Put data generation scripts in inst/data-raw/
- Put vignettes in vignettes/

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all functions
- Aim for 100% test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use testthat framework
- Run tests frequently during development

## Dependencies

- Use `make install-deps` to install required packages
- Minimize external dependencies
- Prefer base R and established packages

## Getting Help

- Run `make help` to see all available commands
- See `make dev-guide` for R package development guide
